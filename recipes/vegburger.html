    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oil and your stove.</li>
        <li>Put fries in the oil and burger patties in the stove with some parchment paper</li>
        <li>Take your vegetables and slice the tomato and onions, and cut a piece of lettuce to fit your bun. Make sure to wash them before.</li>
        <li>When there's two minutes left on both the burger and the fries, lightly toast your buns and start assembling the base of the burger</li>
        <li><em>Optional - </em> Put your cheese under where the patty will go, as well as on top so it lightly melts</li>
        <li>Remove the fries from the oil and place them on a piece of kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil - now is a great time to season them to taste aswell</li>
        <li>Place your patty on in the burger</li>
