# Odin Recipes
Odin Recipes is a simple project where we are tasked with applying the knowledge gathered in the previous lessons to create a simple, html-only website that works as a "recipe book".

In this project we used basic html formatting with paragraphs, headings and lists, while reinforcing other necessary knowledge like creating a simple html boilerplate. We also used links and image elements, using both absolute and relative paths to link to elements in the project.

Certainly the biggest competency being reinforced is how to utilize git to maintain version control and drill into us the base git loop of adding and commiting changes, as well as how to clone a repository to our local system.

All in all a simple project where I spent more time than I should writing the actual recipes than I actually spent practicing the html. I'd say the most useful part was getting used to using git.
